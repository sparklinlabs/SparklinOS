# Sparklin OS

Just a fun experiment :).

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## How to use

 * To run in an emulator, start `build_and_qemu.bat` after installing QEMU and NASM.
 * To copy to a USB stick and run on actual hardware, find yourself a [`tools\dd.exe`](https://web.archive.org/web/20200227032953/http://www.chrysocome.net/downloads/dd-0.6beta3.zip) and tweak path and drive letter in `build_and_write.bat`.
   * Alternatively, you can use [DMDE](https://dmde.com/).
   * You'll probably need to disable secure boot and set your USB stick as the boot device.
